## Introduction
Pinched flow fractionation (PFF) is a microfluidic technique that continuously separates particles by size. A PFF device first channels a mixture of particles suspended in liquid into a pinched channel section. As the pinched channel opens to a wider section, the particles separate based on size due to buoyancy forces and are collected through different outlet channels placed on their calculated heights [1].

PFF microfluidic devices are increasingly used for precise particle sorting in biomedical and analytical applications where gentle and continuous separation is required. They are especially valuable for separating specific blood cell types, such as separating circulating tumor cells from white blood cells for cancer diagnosis and monitoring [2]. Unlike traditional methods like filtration or centrifugation, PFF separates particles purely through controlled laminar flow, avoiding clogging and minimizing mechanical stress on delicate cells. This hydrodynamic, label-free approach allows high-throughput, continuous sorting with high viability and precision, making it superior for biological samples.
