## Introduction
Pinched flow fractionation (PFF) is a microfluidic technique that continuously separates particles by size. A PFF device first channels a mixture of particles suspended in liquid into a pinched channel section. As the pinched channel opens to a wider section, the particles separate based on size due to buoyancy forces and are collected through different outlet channels placed at their calculated heights [1].

PFF microfluidic devices are increasingly used for precise particle sorting in biomedical and analytical applications where gentle and continuous separation is required. They are especially valuable for separating specific blood cell types, such as separating circulating tumor cells from white blood cells for cancer diagnosis and monitoring [2]. Unlike traditional methods like filtration or centrifugation, PFF separates particles purely through controlled laminar flow, avoiding clogging and minimizing mechanical stress on delicate cells. This hydrodynamic, label-free approach allows high-throughput, continuous sorting with high viability and precision, making it superior for biological samples.

## Design
* Symmetric: 
  The broad channel widens evenly on both sides after the pinched channel
* Outlet boundaries: 
  Channel heights were mathematically determined based on the width of the sections and particle diameter. Outlet channels were given wide sources to account for error in flow sorting.
* Flow Balancing: 
  Buffer liquid had two outlet ports to compensate for the greater volume of buffer liquid than particle-carrying liquid. Particle outlet channels were long and serpentine to increase resistance and balance the flow rate between all four outlet paths.
